To look soon:

- Need proper color matcher for Jasmine
- setters for `xAxis` and `yAxis` update docs for D3v4.
- Either of `yAxis` or `_useRightYAxis` should go. Better to drop `_useRightYAxis`.
  Current workaround not great.
- Some issue with Transitions. Behavior of `.each()` seems to have changed.
